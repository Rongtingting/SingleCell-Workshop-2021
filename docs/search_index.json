While some required softwares only support Linux or macOS, you could install WSL to use Linux inside Windows. If you already have Linux or macOS, you can skip this section and jump directly to the section of conda installation for Linux or for macOS. The whole process of installing WSL requires at least 2G disk space. Note that this process was tested on Windows 10 (Version 2004, build 19041.1052). 2.1.1 What is the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)? According to the Microsoft Docs, The Windows Subsystem for Linux lets developers run a GNU/Linux environment  including most command-line tools, utilities, and applications  directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dualboot setup. 2.1.2 Manual Installation Steps Step 1. Enable required feature in Windows PowerShell It is necessary to enable the required feature for WSL before installing it. Type powershell in the search box of the Windows taskbar. Right click Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator. Type the command below in PowerShell. dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux Step 2. Download and install WSL Microsoft now supports several Linux distributions as WSL, such as Ubuntu, openSUSE, Fedora, etc (a full list here), among which we choose Ubuntu as an example. Ubuntu WSL could be freely downloaded and installed through Microsoft Store. Go to the webpage for Ubuntu in Microsoft Store. Click on the Get button. Wait for completion of downloading and installation. Click on the Launch button. Step 3. Create a new account for Ubuntu After successfully installing Ubuntu, a new user account should be created. Type user name and password following the prompts on the screen. Note, it is normal that the password is invisible when you are typing. Now Congratulations! You have successfully installed and set up Ubuntu in your Windows System! Next time you can re-open Ubuntu through the search box of the Windows taskbar. More information about the usage of WSL can be found at Microsoft Docs. 2.2 Install Conda Environment The whole process of installing conda environment requires at least 1G disk space. 2.2.1 What is conda? Conda is part of the Anaconda platform. According to the Anaconda docs, Anaconda Individual Edition is a free, easy-to-install package manager, environment manager, and Python distribution with a collection of 1,500+ open source packages with free community support. Anaconda is platform-agnostic, so you can use it whether you are on Windows, macOS, or Linux. For quick installation and configuration, we choose to install Miniconda instead of the whole Anaconda. Miniconda is a free minimal installer for conda. It is a small, bootstrap version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful packages, including pip, zlib and a few others. 2.2.2 Installation on Windows Although it is easy to install Miniconda itself on Windows, there are several conda softwares (e.g., bcftools, cellsnp-lite) required for this workshop that are well-supported only on Unix-Like systems. Linux or macOS is essential to use those softwares. Good news is that Microsoft has provided the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), which enables you to use several Linux distributions on Windows 10. The installation of WSL is easy and details can be found here. After installing WSL, you could follow Section Installation on Linux to install Miniconda on WSL. 2.2.3 Installation on Linux This section is adapted based on Miniconda installation guides for Linux. In this section, we select the Miniconda with Python 3.9 as an example. Step 1. Open Shell Open Linux Shell / WSL Shell (see Section Install WSL for details of WSL). Step 2. Download Miniconda installer The Miniconda installer is a .sh file containing metadata of installation. Run wget &lt;installer_link&gt; to download the installer. e.g., Type in Shell wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py39_4.9.2-Linux-x86_64.sh. You could choose other Miniconda installers based on your platform. A full list of installers can be found here. Step 3. Verify your installer hashes (Optional) An unmatched hash indicates there were some error during the downloading process. We could simply verify the installer hashes by typing sha256sum &lt;installer_file&gt; in the Shell. e.g., Type sha256sum Miniconda3-py39_4.9.2-Linux-x86_64.sh and check if the output hash is 536817d1b14cb1ada88900f5be51ce0a5e042bae178b5550e62f61e223deae7c. A full list of hashes can be found here. Step 4. Initialize Miniconda Run bash &lt;installer_file&gt; in Shell. e.g., Type bash Miniconda3-py39_4.9.2-Linux-x86_64.sh. Follow the prompts on the installer screens. When you are asked Do you wish the installer to initialize Miniconda3 by running conda init, we recommend yes. When the initialization is done, it looks like, Step 5. Close and re-open Shell Close and then re-open your Shell, to make the changes take effect. The screen should have a new (base) prefix, which looks like, It means the Shell is now in the base environment of conda. Step 6. Test your installation Type conda list in Shell. A list of installed packages appears if it has been installed correctly. 2.2.4 Installation on macOS You could refer to the Section Installation on Linux as the processes of installing Miniconda on macOS and Linux are quite similar. We briefly list the steps here for your quick reference. Step 1. Open macOS Terminal Step 2. Download Miniconda installer Type in Terminal wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py39_4.9.2-MacOSX-x86_64.sh. Step 3. Verify your installer hashes (Optional) Type shasum -a 256 Miniconda3-py39_4.9.2-MacOSX-x86_64.sh in Terminal and check if the output hash is b3bf77cbb81ee235ec6858146a2a84d20f8ecdeb614678030c39baacb5acbed1. Step 4. Initialize Miniconda Type in Terminal bash Miniconda3-py39_4.9.2-MacOSX-x86_64.sh. Follow the prompts on the installer screens. When you are asked Do you wish the installer to initialize Miniconda3 by running conda init, we recommend yes. Step 5. Close and re-open Terminal Step 6. Test your installation Type conda list in Terminal. A list of installed packages appears if it has been installed correctly. 2.3 Other Preparation 2.3.1 Conda Configuration To simplify the configuration of conda environment, we have pre-compiled a conda environment, named sgcell, containing some required softwares for this workshop. The corresponding metafile sgcell.yml of this environment was exported, based on which we can easily re-build the pre-compiled environment. The sgcell.yml can be downloaded from sgcellworkshop repo on sourceforge. Assuming you have installed conda and activated any environment in the Shell / Terminal (if not, please install conda based on Section Install Conda Environment first). Then, Open Linux Shell / macOS Terminal / WSL Shell Add conda channels, conda config --add channels bioconda conda config --add channels conda-forge Re-build the pre-compiled environment (Note that this can fail due to unstable connection to the server, please re-try for several times). conda env create -f sgcell.yml Activate the new environment sgcell, conda activate sgcell Verify if the new environment was installed correctly, conda env list The sgcell sould appear in the listed environments.

It could be easily installed via conda with conda install -c bioconda -c conda-forge cellsnp-lite. We use a SMART-seq2 dataset as an example, which were packed into joxm.bam.all.77.tar.gz (77 bam files, ~3.5G in total; McCarthy et al, 2020). First, please download joxm.bam.all.77.tar.gz, joxm.hg19.bam.lst and joxm.sample.lst from sgcellworkshop repo on sourceforge. Put the three files in the same directory. Then unpack the bam files with command tar zxvf joxm.bam.all.77.tar.gz. The bam files, together with the .bai files, should be in the sort/ directory. 6.1.1 Pileup without given SNPs In this example, we use cellsnp-lite to pileup chrM on the bam files without a given SNP list (in denovo mode), whose output could be used as inputs of MQuad model for mitochondrial clone analysis. Note that the pileup results joxm.hg19.cellsnp.mode2b.tar.gz can be downloaded from sgcellworkshop repo on sourceforge and then unpacked with command tar zxvf joxm.hg19.cellsnp.mode2b.tar.gz. The command line to generate the results is, cellsnp-lite \\ -S ./joxm.hg19.bam.lst \\ -i ./joxm.sample.lst \\ -O ./cellsnp2b \\ --chrom MT \\ --cellTAG None \\ --UMItag None \\ --minCOUNT 20 \\ --minMAF 0 \\ --genotype \\ --gzip 6.1.2 Pileup with given SNPs This time, we use cellsnp-lite to pileup given SNPs on the bam files. The 112 SNPs, stored in joxm.hg19.somatic.sites.vcf, were somatic SNPs called in (McCarthy et al, 2020) and can be downloaded from sgcellworkshop repo. Note that the pileup results joxm.hg19.somatic.cellsnp.mode1b.tar.gz can be downloaded from sgcellworkshop repo on sourceforge and then unpacked with command tar zxvf joxm.hg19.somatic.cellsnp.mode1b.tar.gz.
